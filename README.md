# Lending club case study
> EDA to understand how consumer attributes and loan attributes influence the tendency of loan default.
> If one is able to identify these risky loan applicants, then such loans can be reduced thereby cutting down the amount of credit loss. Identification of such applicants using EDA is the aim of this case study.
> In other words, EDA to understand the driving factors (or driver variables) behind loan default, i.e. the variables which are strong indicators of default.
